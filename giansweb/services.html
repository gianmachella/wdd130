                <h1>Services</h1>
                <p>With over five years of experience as a frontend software developer, I offer specialized services
                    that
                    combine strong
                    technical skills with a focused approach to user experience (UX) design. My background in frontend
                    development has
                    allowed me to hone my skills in creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces that improve user
                    interaction with web
                    applications and sites.</p>

                <p>I stand out for my deep knowledge of frontend technologies, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which
                    allows
                    me to build
                    robust and responsive interfaces. My focus on UX design ensures that each project is not only
                    functional,
                    but also
                    enjoyable and easy to use for end users. This combination of technical skills and intuitive design
                    allows my
                    clients to
                    stand out in an increasingly competitive digital marketplace.</p>

                <p>Additionally, my experience encompasses effective collaboration with multidisciplinary teams,
                    facilitating
                    the
                    integration of frontend solutions with other aspects of software development. My commitment to
                    quality
                    and
                    innovation is
                    reflected in each project, where I seek to exceed expectations and provide technological solutions
                    that
                    make
                    a
                    difference.</p>

                <p>In short, as a frontend software developer with over five years of experience, I offer services that
                    fuse
                    advanced
                    technical skills with a focus on UX design, providing my clients with digital solutions that not
                    only
                    meet
                    their
                    requirements but also elevate the user experience to new levels.</p>
